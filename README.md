### Welcome to my Calculator App using Javascript!

<br />

As I've been strengthening my abilities with Javascript and algorithms, I decided to build a fully functional calculator!

For the most part, I decided to use this project to target personal challenges, such as rendering everything through the DOM, refraining from the use of the infamous javascript function eval(), and of course...algorithms!

While I'm content with its current state, I intend on making iterative imporvements upon this project in the near future and as much as I can!

### Thanks for looking!
